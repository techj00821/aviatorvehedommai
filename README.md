## What is Aviator?

Aviator is a unique crash game developed by Spribe, a leading provider
of innovative casino games. Unlike traditional slot machines or table
games, Aviator offers a thrilling and unpredictable gaming experience.
The game features a plane that takes off and flies higher and higher,
increasing the multiplier with each passing second.

As a player, your goal is to cash out your winnings before the plane
flies away. The longer you wait, the higher the multiplier, but also the
greater the risk of losing your bet. With its fast-paced gameplay and
potential for huge payouts, Aviator has quickly become a favorite among
Indian casino players.
